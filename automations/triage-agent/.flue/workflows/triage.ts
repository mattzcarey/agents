/**
 * The triage agent.
 *
 * Runs automatically on every newly opened issue and applies fitting labels
 * from the repo's EXISTING label set.
 *
 * Security posture (runs on untrusted issue input):
 *   - NO shell and NO filesystem tools — `noShellSandbox()` replaces the
 *     default workspace tool list with nothing. An injected instruction in an
 *     issue body cannot run commands or read files.
 *   - Only three typed tools: `view_issue`, `list_labels`, `apply_labels`.
 *     The GitHub token, repo, and issue number are read from `process.env`
 *     inside each tool — never exposed to the model, never model-selectable.
 *   - `apply_labels` validates against existing labels, so the model cannot
 *     create labels; there is no tool to comment, delete, or touch other
 *     issues.
 *
 * Because there is no sandbox filesystem, the triage playbook is inlined here
 * as `instructions` rather than discovered as a skill file.
